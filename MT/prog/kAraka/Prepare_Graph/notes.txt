KarwqsamAnAXikaraNam versus viXeya viSeRaNam
We have decided to use karwqsamAnAXikaraNam because there are cases where with the kqxanwa, karwqrahiwakarwqsamAnAXikaraNam is used. 
If we decide to change the name for karwqsamAnAXikaraNam to viXeya viSeRaNam, then we will have to link it with the karwA, and in the case of karwqrahiwakarwqsamAnAXikaraNam, since the karwA would not be availbale, we will face a problem.

We decided to change kqrwqsamAnAXikaraNam to viXeya viSeRaNam, marking the relation with the karwA.
In the case of BUwvA, etc we mark the relation with the verb. This is something unintuitive, but such cases are very rare.
