		<p>This is a project of Post Doctoral Research approved by U.G.C.,
		on <code>Śiśupālavadha of Māgha</code> through a complete computational linguistic
		approach, being done by <code>Dr. Ryali Anupama</code> under the mentorship of<code>Prof. Amba Kulkarni</code>. It
		helps those Sanskrit lovers, who want to learn or teach the kāvya
		through the approach of khandānvaya. Several tools for analysis of
		Sanskrit texts have been made available by the consortium of Sanskrit
		Hindi Machine Translation led by University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad,
		at <a href="http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/scl" target="_blank">http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/scl</a> . Use of these tools will facilitate the
		poetic usability for a linguist and also for a learner. Thus using
		these tools, a complete analysis of Śiśupālavadha of Māgha is being
		developed by creating a web version, which serves the purpose of
		research, education, teaching and evaluation. Software/Tools used -
	</p>
	<p>The main interface that will be used in the project is anusāraka. It
		provides -</p>
	<ul>
		
		<li>User controlled access to various levels of analysis.</li>
		<li>Link to various dictionaries for meanings of the head words.</li>
		<li>Graphical display of phrase structure analysis of compounds.</li>
		<li>Graphical display of sentential analysis.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This provides a user a digitized learning/understanding
		environment. Apart from this, various other tools such as
		Transliteration, Sandhi – splitter, Morphological generator,
		Morphological analyzer, Sanskrit Hindi Machine Translation System
		etc., will be used. These are created by CGA programming in HTML of
		Apache Server.</p>
