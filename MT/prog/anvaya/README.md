# Dandanvayajanaka

Dandanvayajanaka (hereafter DAJ) is a part of [Samsaadhanii](https://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/scl) tools. It takes a dependency tree generated by Samsaadhanii's Anusaaraka as an input, reorders the tree into the natural prose word order of the target language and outputs a similar dependency tree mapping the original word IDs to the reordered prose order IDs.

## Usage

> Install dependent libraries mentioned below before running the tool.

    python3 reorder.py -i input_file -s scl_path [-o output_file] [-t target_language]

Input and output files can be CSV, TSV or XLSX formats. If the output file is not mentioned, words in the dependency tree will be printed to `STDOUT` in a reordered sequence.

`scl_path` is the root directory of the [SCL](https://github.com/samsaadhanii/scl) installation. It is required for loading `relations.txt` file which contains the list of relations and their numeric IDs.

Target language can be given in two-letter alphabetic code as specified in [ISO 639-1:2002](https://www.iso.org/standard/22109.html). Default is `sa` (Sanskrit).
