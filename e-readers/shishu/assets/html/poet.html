			<h2 class="">THE POET MĀGHA</h2>

		Māgha's Śiśupālavadha occupies a prominent place among the kāvyas of bṛhattrayī  and pañcamahākāvyas of Sanskrit literature. Though, it is the only known available work of the poet, he is called Mahākavi, as it possesses all the virtues of a Mahākāvya. This work closes with the words,<code> 'इति श्रीभिन्नमालवास्तव्यदत्तकसूनोर्महावैय्याकरणस्य माघस्य कृतौ शिशुपालवधे'. </code> In these closing stanzas of his work he discloses about his clan with one or two particulars that he was the son of Dattaka and grandson of Suprabhadeva, where the latter was the chief minister at the court of king Śrī Varmala.</p>
		<p>The word <code> 'महावैय्याकरणस्य' </code>in the above extract shows that the poet earned the reputation of being erudite in the science of vyākaraṇa. Moreover, his mastery on the science of vyākaraṇa is evidenced by his work itself. The variety of grammatical forms and constructions which he uses, the illustrations and similitudes with which he embellishes or substantiates his ideas through out the poem, the learned discussion on the morality and expediency of war in the second canto – all these bear ample testimony to his thorough acquaintance with the subject and thus, undoubtedly can be proclaimed as a profound scholar.
		</p>
		<p>Thus, being a very celebrated poet, he accomodated various aspects of many śāstras such as vyākaraṇa, rājanīti, arthaśāstra, dharmaśāstra, kāmaśāstra, jyautiṣa, saṅgīta, pākaśāstra, hastividyā, aśvaśāstra, purāṇas etc., in this grand epic. The kāvya is endowed with the three important virtues of a best kāvya, i.e., Upamā  of kālidāsa, Arthagauravam  of Bhāravi and Padalālityam of Daṇḍi. Hence, the popular notion 'māghe santi trayo guṇāḥ' came into existence. Mallinātha a famous commentator of this work, quoted on Māgha, 'navasarge gate māghe nava śabdo na vidyate' i.e., one who completes reading nine cantos of Māgha, will not find a new word to read. He also quoted - 'māghe meghe vayaṃ gataḥ' meaning, we will be lost in understanding Māghakāvya and Meghadūta.</p>
