	"para":"Shrimadbhagavadgita or Gita is an axiomatic scripture which defines the Hinduism or Sanatana Dharma. It has 700 verses divided into 18 chapters. It is a part of epic Mahabharata (Bhishma Parva). It is built in a narrative framework of a dialogue between third Pandava Arjuna and his charioteer Lord Krishna in the battle-field of Kurukshetra. The initial dilema towards the Dharmayuddha of Arjuna and its solution given by Lord Krishna leads us towards the ultimate truth of life that churns various philosophical aspects of Sanatana Dharma."

	"para":"Day by Day Bahagavadgita integrates various school of thoughts by several commentaries and translations. Those commentaries are very helpful to reader to understand the text, are but only secondery sources. Even the ancient commentaries which were entirely written in Sanskrit poses difficulty for those who could not understand the intricasies of the language. In order to have direct access to the original Sanskrit text, one needs to have good background of Sanskrit grammar especially of Aṣṭādhyāyī or Siddhānta-Kaumudī which is both time-consuming and tedious. Since majority of Sanskrit literature are in verse style, sufficient knowledge of chandas (metres) is also necessary. Additionally, for understanding the primary word meanings of each word, one needs the help of dictionary. But that too has its drawbacks, since to search a dictionary manually is again time-consuming and it does not cover all the compounds too. The current technology now makes it possible to reduce the learning time. It is possible to build accessors that can provide complete help, both at grammatical level as well as lexical level, at the click of a button."
